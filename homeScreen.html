            </div>
            <h2>Game Rules: </h2>
              <p>The goal of the game is to call a "Set" of 3 cards from 12 cards laid out on the table. The deck is made up of 81 unique cards with a variation of these four features: </p>
              <div class = "listContainer">
                <ul>
                  <li>Color - Red, Green or Purple</li>
                  <li>Symbol - Oval, Squiggle or Diamond</li>
                  <li>Number - One, Two or Three</li>
                  <li>Shading - Solid, Open or Striped</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>A "Set" consists of 3 cards in which each feature is either the same on each car or is different on each card. Any feature in the "Set: is either common to all 3 or different on each card. </p>
            
            <h2>Example Sets:</h2>
              <div class = "listContainer">
                <ul>
                  <li>All 3 cards are red, ovals, two symbols and all have different shadings.</li>
                  <li>All 3 cards have difference colors, symbols and numbers and all 3 have the same shading.</li>
                  <li>All 3 cards have different colors, symbols, numbers and shadings.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            
            <h2>Non Set Examples:</h2>
              <div class = "listContainer">
                <ul> 
                  <li>All 3 cards have different colors, shapes and numbers, and 2 are open one is not.</li>
                  <li>All 3 cards are squiggles, have different shadings and numbers, however two are red and one is not.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p><b>"Magic Rule": </b><em>If two are... and one is not, then it is not* a set. </em></p>
          
            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>The deck is shuffled and 12 cards are layed out face up on the screen to be seen by all.
                Players can remove a "Set" of 3 cards as they are seen. Each "Set" is checked by the game. If correct, the "Set" is kept by the player, their score increases and the 3 cards are replaced from the deck, if they are incorrect, they will lose a point.
                Players do not take turns, but instead pick them up as soon as they are seen. To aquire a set, a player must "call" set by clicking the set button before selecting the cards. If the set has not been "called" no cards may be selected.
                After "calling" set the player has 10 seconds to select a set, otherwise the player will lose a point and the 3 cards will be returned to the table.
                If more than 3 cards are selected the player's set will be reset and the player will recieve a warning.
                The hint button may be pressed at any time in the game, for a maximum of 5 hints.
                It is possible to recieve negative points if more wrong sets were chosen then correct sets.
                If there are no sets within the 12 dealt cards, the deck will be reshuffled and 12 new cards will be dealt.
                The game continues on until there are no sets left in the entire deck.
                The game may be ended automatically (when no sets are available in the entire deck) or by clicking the "Quit" button.</p>
            <h2>CPU Rules</h2>
            <p>If no difficulty level is set, the CPU will automatically play under medium difficulty
                If the CPU calls a set, a player may not call set until the new cards are dealt
                The player with the highest score at the end wins.</p>
